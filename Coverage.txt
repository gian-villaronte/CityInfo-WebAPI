builder.services
	-AddSingleton lifetime services created the first time they're created
	-AddTransient lifetime services created each time they're requested. Great for lightweight and stateless services
	-AddScoped lifetime services created once per request

from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection-usage
-Transient services are always different, a new instance is created with every retrieval of the service.
-Scoped services change only with a new scope, but are the same instance within a scope.
-Singleton services are always the same, a new instance is only created once.
